# dev-web-page
This is a personal webpage made in order for me to practice my skills and continue coding on my off time.
I will be placing projects I make overtime in a display and attempted to redesign and refresh the website on a regular basis.
Currently using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript but will debate remaking it with React once I have more experience in it.
